Needed a fresh new start
Why not have a fresh new look , I choose to play around with the scissors.
I’ve always desired to have my natural hair out and away with all the weaves and wigs .
And what better way to show off my iconic hair cut other than having a shoot with the talented award winning
Italian – Ugandan Photographer Giulio Molfese
