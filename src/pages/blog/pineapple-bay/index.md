Pineapple Bay, a hidden jewel in the middle of lake
victoria on Bulago island, is a 45 minutes boat ride
from mainland Munyonyo (Kampala) and about 35 minutes
from Entebbe . You can decide to fly to the resort
but I used a speed boat as I love being on water.
By the time we got to the resort  It was almost 7 pm ,
we had the welcome drink, the legendary pineapple juice.
It was fresh with a taste so delicious .

      I could not fail to notice the white sand at the lake shore ,
      beautiful clear and clean water so tempting for a night swim , I was advised not to as it was already getting dark , a time where crocodiles roam the waters.

        I kicked off right away with a shoot by the poolside, the back view was magnificent ,the color of the skies was unreal extremely beautiful breathtakingly so .

        I couldn’t let the night come before getting those perfect shots. I wore a green dress made and designed in Uganda by the gifted Fatumah Asha; Uganda’s fastest growing Designer . I slept well 
        knowing I had secured those beautiful sunset shots.

        My favorite moment was my last shoot on top of the hill a 2km hike . Its what they call a forest walk, such great exercise and dare I say only a real strong woman can walk up a hill and still pose for the camera pulling off a  a great shoot.
