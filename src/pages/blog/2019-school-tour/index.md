Dr. Ben Carson, a renowned Neurosurgeon, once said, ‘Education is Liberation.’ His statement couldn’t be truer. I also believe that education is learning from experience and a continuous process, as every day brings its own form of learning. The Bettinah Tianah Foundation was created with one goal in mind: To make a change.

<p>
I had the opportunity to be invited by Samantha Bantu Olivia, a Vienna College student and an ardent follower of mine via Instagram, to speak to her classmates on a range of issues such as career guidance and self-love
</p>
<p>
Our next campaign is to provide a voice and share skills that are not often much paid attention to in schools. This is not because the schools are incompetent or incapable of providing such skills, but because these skills are life skills that one picks up on their journey of growth, and are therefore worthy of sharing.

I am going to make it a matter of priority to reach out to different schools on invite to share my story and empower the next generation.

The Bettinah Tianah Foundation strives to be the platform where building young adults and helping them understand the world they are going in begins. Our experiences and interactions will be shared on our various social media accounts.
