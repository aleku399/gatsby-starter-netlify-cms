Education is learning from experience; itâ€™s a continuous process as every day brings its own kind of learning.

    I was invited by my online follower Samantha Bantu Olivia via Instagram, a student at Vienna College Namugongo to speak to her classmates about career guidance
<br>
    I enjoyed the interactions as many of them were interested in fashion and TV career paths.

    Starting the month of February, I am taking it upon my self to reach out to more school going pupils and students with support from my friend Anna Muscetta a doctor and the wife of the Italian Ambassador to Uganda.
