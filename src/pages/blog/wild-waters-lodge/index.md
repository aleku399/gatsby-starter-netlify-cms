         Wildwaters Lodge ,  located on a private island in the middle of the Nile River is everything you want for a quiet relaxing get away. The lodge can only be accessed by a rowboat.  Me and my team arrived in mid-afternoon  and we were warmly welcomed by the oarsman. Our canoe sail was so much  fun and safe since a lifejacket was a must , i gazed at the thick riverine forest which covers the private island.

    Once on the island i was  greeted with the customary juice, i could not help it but stare at the rapid waterfalls , Marc Myers my contact to the island told me one is Itanda and the other Kalagala, i walked through the wood decked trails which  lead to the cabins  that are spread along the banks of river Nile.

     I was accommodated in a beautiful cabin which has the African feel as it is roof thatched with a wooden timber floor, canvas walled fully furnished, spacious and the bathroom ware which is carved from local pink granite  is a state of the art , this really caught my eye its like nothing have seen before.

        It has a private deck with an outdoor soaking tub where i  relaxed as i listened to the gushing of the rapids of the nile and the chirping of birds.
